    """
    This function determines the change in the misalignment angle, i.e., the angle between the
    magnetic dipolar moment and the rotation axis of a pulsar. It is taken from eq. (71) of
    Pons & Vigano (2019). For more details see, e.g., Spitkovsky (2006) or Philippov et al.
    (2014), who determine the coefficients k_0, k_1, k_2 (defined in the configuration file)
    for a pulsar embedded in a force-free and resistive magnetosphere from numerical simulations.
    Note that all three input parameters are time-dependent.

    Args:
        B (float): Values of the dipolar component of the magnetic field at the
            magnetic pole for the sample of simulated neutron stars, measured in [G].
        chi (float): Angles between the magnetic dipolar moment, i.e., the magnetic
            field axis, and the rotation axis for all simulated pulsars, measured in [rad].
        P (float): Spin periods of simulated pulsars, measured in [s].
        NS_mass (float): Neutron star mass, measured in [g].
        NS_radius (float): Neutron star radius, measured in [cm].

    Returns:
        (float): Misalignment angle derivatives for all simulated pulsars in [rad/yr].
