# Logging

To log information to both console and file outputs, we make use of Python's built-in `logging` module.

In each module where the logger is used, we first import the logging module and get it using the `getLogger` function:
```commandline
import logging
[...]
log = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

Then, we issue logging messages at the appropriate level as follows:
```commandline
log.debug("add debug info")
log.info("add info")
log.warning("add warning message")
log.error("add error log message")
```

As an example, if we run the script to simulate a population of 100 neutron stars using the standard configuration 
file, the following logging information is shown:

If the `show_profiling` option in the `mlpoppyns/simulator/config_simulator.py` file is set to `True`, the timing profile
for each section of the simulator is also shown in the terminal. In addition to the terminal output, the timing 
information is saved as a `profile.log` file in the same folder in which the output of the simulation is saved.
Function-specific profiling can also be activated by setting `enable_profiles` and / or `show_profiles` to `True`.
The detailed information will be saved in the location specified under the flag `profiles_dir` in the configuration 
file.
