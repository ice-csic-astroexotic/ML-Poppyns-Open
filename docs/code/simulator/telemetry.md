## Magneto-rotational simulation

Timing profile for the `simulate_population_magrot_det.py` script with the default configuration in `config_simulator.py`.

Here, we report the full computation time for a magneto-rotational simulation including the application of 
our detection filters when loading a dynamical database with 300,000 neutron stars. In addition, we also give 
the average time and standard deviation over seven loops when sampling from the dynamical database with a 
batch size of 100,000 stars and applying the observational filters accordingly.

Note that in the final loops of the detection procedure, the time to perform these calculations is shorter
due to the reduced batch size. We do not take into account these loops when computing the mean and standard deviations given below. However, the total time accounts for all loops.
