# Downloading ATNF Pulsar Catalogue

When downloading information from the [ATNF Pulsar Catalogue](https://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat/), 
we selected the following parameters:

JName, PMRA, PMDec, PX, PosEpoch, Gl, Gb, RaJD, DecJD, P0, P1, DM, W50, W10, Tau_sc, S400, S1400, S2000, Dist, Dist_DM, 
ZZ, XX, YY, Assoc, Survey, Type.

To exclude neutron stars in binaries, we use the filter `!type(BINARY)` in the `Condition` field.
We choose the output style to be `Short csv without errors` and replace the default null value `*` with `NAN`.

Finally, we click on the `TABLE` button at the end of the web page. 
This will produce a table that can be copied and pasted into a text editor and saved in `.csv` format.

Note that we have updated the spin periods of pulsars listed in Table 1 in [Song et al. (2023)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.520.4562S/abstract) 
by hand because version 2.4.0 of the ATNF Catalogue used for this study does not contain the true pulsar
spin periods but instead the harmonics.

# Downloading TPA MeerKAT data

To download the TPA MeerKAT data, we refer to the work by [Posselt et al. (2023)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.520.4582P/abstract). 
The data can be downloaded [here](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/520/3/4582/7049638#supplementary-data).

In particular, the table containing the flux information is given in the file `Census_Table5.csv`.
