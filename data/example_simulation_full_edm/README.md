# Full simulation example with electron-density model

This is an example of a full simulation (dynamical + magneto-rotational + detection) run with the `simulate_population_full.py` script and using the default parameters in the configuration file.

For this simulation, we used the Galactic electron density model to sample the initial positions in the Galaxy.
To this end, we have set the parameter `sample_edm` to `True` in the configuration file.

To run this example, we use the following command:
```commandline
python mlpoppyns/simulator/simulate_population_full.py --save_dir data/example_simulation_full_edm
```
