"""
    Population sampler script.

    This script randomly samples a population with a reduced number of stars for every
    population simulated from the simulator `initialize_evolve_population.py`
    with different initial parameters.

    This expects that a set of populations have been generated either using
    directly that script or using the helper with its particular directory tree.

    The user can choose the total number of stars to randomly select from the
    original simulated population, they can provide a weighted selection according to
    the stars' distances from the Sun and can provide a distance cut-off to select only stars
    that are nearer to the Sun.

    The resampled population is also saved in a .pkl.gz file alongside with the .json
    file containing the related labels.

    Display help message to run the code:

    python pop_sampler.py --help

    Displays all the relevant arguments that can be used.
