    Experiment launcher script.

    This script helps running multiple experiments by taking a list of commands and
    executing them with a process pool. This way, a huge list of experiments can
    be left running unattended.

    Display help message to run the code:

    python experiment_launcher.py --help

    Displays all the relevant arguments that can be used.
